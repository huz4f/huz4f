      <description>When you Google &amp;lsquo;Kashmir&amp;rsquo;s Fertility Rate&amp;quot; you get this: Google gives reasons that actually make sense but what can be the underlying cause? People are not even aware, this might be the most important thing to focus on yet is getting negleted and unnoticed by almost everyone, even to me it randomly crossed my mind and i googled about it.
Urban areas now having TFR of 1.2 and rural 1.5, 35% women and 45 % men have fertility problems.</description>

      <description>Came across this while reading a book:
Story is about a little sheep in a Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s flock.
This little sheep liked to wander off and Shepherd after noticing it couple of times broke off all it&amp;rsquo;s legs (brutal right). Aren&amp;rsquo;t shephered supposed to love sheep?
Now he carries this 4 legged broken sheep everywhere around his neck, feeding, washing and taking care of everything till finally the sheep is ready to go.</description>

      <description>Blocks and Hashing Smart Contract Blockchain: -&amp;gt; Have also written: Blockchain.
Demonstration: How BlockChain works using cocoa and SHA-1 checksum utility
-&amp;gt; One block connected to the genesis block and hash function with 2 zeroes at start Swiftcode on GitHub: Here ( needs shasum file for the hash )
Understanding Code: Block in a blockchain consists of Block Header &amp;amp; Body
The head consists of:
Previous block&amp;rsquo;s hash Merkel root (compact hash sum of all transactions) Block version Nonce (it is calculated) Timestamp The condition you set for which nonce is calculated The body consists of Transaction lists.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Data is everywhere and everything in today&amp;rsquo;s day and age&amp;rsquo; Advancement in technology has enabled us to keep our data online from our private credentials to backup of our gallery photos. You don&amp;rsquo;t need local storage and access.
But there is no cloud is there?
Just some server on the internet that contains our precious data, that can be used in devastating ways against us from knowing our personal info to having our every digital footprint recorded.</description>
