In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web at CERN, combining hypertext, the HTTP protocol, and a system of unique addresses (URLs) to access resources. This sparked an explosion of websites and search engines to navigate them. web1 lasted from 1991 to 2004. It was static, web 2 (social web) switched from information only to communication use of web (more below)\nBrowsers: Text-based browsers like Lynx (1992) navigated the internet before the widespread use of graphics.The WorldWideWeb was the first browser ever created by Tim Berners-Lee, then renamed Nexus to differentiate from the actual World Wide Web. Unlike today, this was the only way to access the web then.\nThen in 1993 Mosaic was the first browser to allow images embedded in text making it the world’s first most popular browser.Microsoft released Internet Explorer in 1995, it’s integration with the Windows operating system eventually led to its dominance and Apple released safari in 2003. Google’s rapid innovation and focus on speed and simplicity made Chrome incredibly popular, dethroning Internet Explorer in 2008.\nCurrent changes Web: As the web matured, it transformed into a platform for user-generated content (Web 2.0) through blogs, social media, and videos. The rise of smartphones and tablets drove the need for mobile-friendly web experiences. Today, the web continues to evolve with advances in AI, VR, and a greater focus on privacy and security. (more in web3) Web apps are also replacing native apps, recently PWAs were banned in EU by apple. Slowly but surely software dev will also change as internet becomes faster and web apps more robust, adding a shortcut to website sounds better to everyone than downloading an app. Even i have chatGPT in my dock and haven’t bothered to check if there is an app.\nBrowsers: Today we have various different browsers available. Some focused on privacy while others on functionality. I’ve have been using Arc browser for more than a year now, Got an invitation link during it’s beta phase and let me tell you i’ve used 10+ browsers before it. Even though safari is synced across devices and i like to get back to reading on my phone. Since arc i rarely use any other browser, won’t explain why just try it yourself.\nBut why am i writing this? Because arc recently released a new app (currently on ios only) called ‘Arc search’ and i believe it’s future of browsing the internet. Core concept is you can do a basic search or you can ask the AI built into the browser to create a personalized webpage for your query that will take information from relevant webpages in real time and put it in a custom page presented to you. Quite fascinating right.\nWeb3 After web2 some suggested web3 will be “semantic web” where intelligent devices and IoT systems interpret data meaningfully. Others envision a metaverse (vaguely defined alternate reality powered by VR and AR) A more technical definition centers on decentralization, where data is distributed among users, ensuring availability regardless of location.\nWhile there’s debate between “Web 3.0” and simply “Web3,” the latter often focuses on blockchains as the key enabler of decentralization. Overall, Web3 represents an umbrella term for the quest to distribute power and control of data within the evolving online world.\nWeb 3.0: The Semantic Web Focus: Improving the organization and understanding of web content for both humans and machines. Technologies: Linked data, ontologies, RDF (Resource Description Framework), machine learning for interpreting data. Aims: A more intelligent and interconnected web, better search results, tailored experiences.\nWeb3: The Decentralized Web Focus: Shifting power away from large tech companies and giving control of data and identity back to users. Technologies: Blockchains, cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications (dApps). Aims: A more secure, censorship-resistant web, new models of ownership and monetization.\nMetaverse A virtual space with a blockchain economy where we can live and work economy though crypto curencies metaverse funding through blockchain meta managment thruogh DAOs assets as NFTs More about web3 Being called techno-utopian libertarian view of the world, where every problem can be solved if we use enough technology at it. It is real world manifestation of the feeling of powerlessness that comes with so called free services that collet every bit of data and is used to manipulate the user more.It is a push back against suveliance captialism, everyone has power and control over assets.\nIncluding various goals Web3 aims to foster open access to information and Re engineer the web ecosystem to run on the distributed decentralized blockchain, to Tockenize all data on the web and make it tradable. To be single source of truth and from social media posts to property deeds in proposed future all the valuable data will be decentralized\nEveryone knows bitcoin (based on Laissez-faire capitalism+Meritocratic rule) motivation behind it was also to be transparent and take out fraunds of centralised financial system.\nMore about decentralization HERE\nDark Web There is a a collection of websites that operate in a shadowy corner of the internet, it can be accessed using secure,anonymized connection called Tor network.\nCriminal activity is the highest profile use of dark web.Yet the onion routing, cornerstone tech that makes dark web possible was actually developed by a team of mathematicians and computer scientists in 1990s at US research govt laboratory. After this many large tech companies,govt agencies and other non profit organizations funded The non profit Tor Foundation for it’s potential benefits.\nGovt agencies use Dark web to communicate with their agents. Washington post uses dark web to communicate with it’s journalists, without revealing their true identity. There are many legitimate uses of Dark web. Tor network can bypass govt firewalls and content filtering.\nBut how do you use Tor network? You need Tor browser or os integration like whonix. You can also use CLI tools like cURL.\nDark web works on the Perfect Forward secrecy: Entry node (only this knows you) Relay node (can have multiple relay nodes) Exit node (knows destination) Directory servers play a crucial role in Dark web by maintaining Tor nodes. There are unadvertised Bridge Nodes that serve as entry when Directory servers are blocked.\nHere is a gift for cybersecurity enthusiasts ;)\nDeep web refers to anything on the internet that is not indexed and accessible via a search engine like Google. Deep web content includes anything behind a paywall or requires sign-in credentials. It also includes any content that its owners have blocked web crawlers from indexing.\n","wordCount":"1178","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/articles/wb.png","datePublished":"2024-02-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-02-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Huzaif"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/articles/web--browsers/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Huzaif","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/ accesskey=h title="< 𝖍𝖚/> (Alt + H)">&lt; 𝖍𝖚/></a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/articles/ title=Tech><span>Tech</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/blogs/ title=Blogs><span>Blogs</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/articles/>Articles</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent"></h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 8, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Huzaif</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=http://localhost:1313/huz4f/huz4f.git/articles/wb.png alt></figure><div class=post-content><h2 id=ever-questioned-how-do-you-see-a-website>Ever questioned how do you see a website?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ever-questioned-how-do-you-see-a-website>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>visiting my website through a <strong>Browser</strong>?</p></blockquote><p>The browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on (IP address).
