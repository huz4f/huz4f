Story is about a little sheep in a Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s flock,
This little sheep liked to wander off and Mr.Shepherd after noticing it couple times broke off all his legs (brutal right). Aren&amp;rsquo;t shephered supposed to love sheep?
Now he holds this 4 legged broken sheep everywhere around his neck, feeding, washing and taking care of everything and when finally the sheep is ready to go.</description>
