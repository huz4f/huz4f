## Every questioned how do you see a website?
> by using a browser?
>
The browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on (IP address).
Browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website you asked for. This message and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.

# History

### World Wide Web:
The web's foundation rests on the invention of hypertext for linking documents, and the internet for global communication. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web at CERN, combining hypertext, the HTTP protocol, and a system of unique addresses (URLs) to access resources.  This sparked an explosion of websites and search engines to navigate them. \

web 2 (social web) from info to communication

### Browsers:
Text-based browsers like Lynx (1992) navigated the internet before the widespread use of graphics.The WorldWideWeb was the first browser ever created by Tim Berners-Lee, then renamed **Nexus** to differentiate from the actual World Wide Web. \
Unlike today, this was the only way to access the web then. 

Then in 1993 Mosaic was the first browser to allow images embedded in text making it the worldâ€™s first most popular browser.Microsoft released Internet Explorer in 1995, it's integration with the Windows operating system eventually led to its dominance and Apple released safari in 2003. Google's rapid innovation and focus on speed and simplicity made Chrome incredibly popular, dethroning Internet Explorer in 2008.

# Current changes

### Web:
As the web matured, it transformed into a platform for user-generated content (Web 2.0) through blogs, social media, and videos. The rise of smartphones and tablets drove the need for mobile-friendly web experiences. Today, the web continues to evolve with advances in AI, VR, and a greater focus on privacy and security.

### Browsers:
I've have been using Arc browser for more than a year now, \
 Got an invitation link during it's beta phase and let me tell you i've used 20+ browsers before it. Even though safari is synced across devices and i like to get back to reading on my phone. Since arc i've rarely used any other browser. It gets updates every single week and has been only getting better with time, wont explain why just try it yourself.

**But why am i writing this?** \
Because arc recently released a new app (currently on ios only) called 'Arc search' and i believe it's future of browsing the internet. Core concept is you can do a basic search or you can ask the **AI built into the browser** to create a personalized webpage for your query that will take information from relevant webpages in real time and put it in a custom page presented to you. Quite fascinating right.

# Web3

web 3 some suggested will be semantic web/special web(smart devices,IoT devices)/meta verse(vaguely defined alternate reality vr/ar)
more techincal-de centralized web where data is distributed among users and avail everywhere
web 3.0 vs web3
web3- de centralized blockchain
umbrella contains all de centralized power and data

### Metaverse 
A virtual space with a blockchain economy where we can live and work
economy though crypto curencies
metaverse funding through blockchain
meta managment thruogh DAOs
assets as NFTs

## Promise of web3
very specific origin 
understnaind where this idea comes from helps us understand promises it is trying to make and where it comes from
Root of web3 idealogy is all about power specifically taking away all the power away from banks
distributed decntrealized blockchains and decntralized storange 
decisions made by concensus, no longer need for centralized power instead evyone has power

push back against suveliance captialism,everyone has power and control over aover ssets that live on the 
real world manifestation of the feeling of powerlessness that comes with so called free services that collet every bit of data and used to manipulate the user more [here]().
Being called techno-utopian libertarina view of the world,where every problem can be solved if we use enough technology at it.
everyon knows about bitcoin (based on Laissez-faire capitalism+Meritocratic rule) motivation behind it was also to be transparent and take out fraunds of centralised financial system.
> **Web3 aims to:**
- Re engineer the web ecosystem to run on the distributed decentralized blockchain
- Tockenize all data on the web and make it tradable 
To be single source of truthfrom social media posts to property deeds
in proposed future all the valuable data will be decentralized
### Decentralization: Host should not be only source of truth

web3: absolute decentralized
web 3: federated model
web2 is participative social web while in web3 you have 
You might have heard of DeFi,dApp but let me tell you about better information sharing protocols we can have
DeSci facilitates the creation of decentralized platforms where scientific knowledge is accessible .Researchers can share findings, collaborate, and access data without traditional barriers, fostering open access to information


# Dark Web
There is a a collection of websites that operate in a shadowy corner of the internet, it can be accessed using secure,anonymized connection called Tor network.

Criminal activity is the highest profile use of dark web.Yet the opnion routing ( the cornerstone tech that makes dark web possible) was actually developed by US.A team of mathematicians and computer scientists in 1990s at US research  govt laboratory.After this many large tech companies,govt agencies and other non profit organizations funded **The non profit Tor Foundation** \
Got agencies use Dark web to communicate with their agents.
Washington post uses dark web to communicate with it's journalists, without revealing their true identity.There are many legitimate uses of Dark web.

Tor network can bypass govt firewalls and content filtering.
