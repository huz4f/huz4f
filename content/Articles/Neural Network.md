# Neural Networks
=Concept of tokens
A neuron can be thought of as a tiny little computer having only one job of taking input 'x' and output a single or multiple numbers 'a' 

A group of neurons is called a layer. A neural network is made up of:
- Input layer (layer 0)
- Hidden layers (activations)
- Output layer

You can think about neural networks as logistic regression unit using new better set of features for output
