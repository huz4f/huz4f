>Cloud computing makes practice of ML accessible and implementation readily availabe.

From being able to run tensorflow on google collab to training models on sagemaker, \
Complicated tasks of installing and managing dependencies on your local computer is taken care of, not to mention the limiting factors of your hardware. 

## Evolvement and need of Machine Learning:
We know, Machine Learning has evolved tremendously over the past decade and now has applications in nearly every field. There is a need for mastery of a wider toolset to move ML experiments from resource phase to more practical applications. \
But the work of building ML projects is really complex and tedious with a lot of manual workflows.We know we are still at the beginning of AI and ML although incredible amount of progress is being made and it holds the future of various industries from business, education, fintech to even healthcare. \
So far most of the development and testing of models have been done locally but the downside is you need multiple virtual environments for different models and frameworks, Also there is a limit to the amount of data you can load into the memory. \
The next common way to develop and run ML models is on a set of powerful servers which may seem less expensive up front, but either they are underutilized or need time and money.
## SageMaker & DevOps:
From not having to download large amount of data to having updated ml frameworks and algorithms at your finger tips,
SageMaker studio makes Machine Learning much convenient, scalable and fast. You can directly put training data from S3 to your customized EC2 instance,
Want to add new features? \
You dont have to go through the whole process of data prep, model training and deployment. You can use jenkins or [CodePipeLine](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/features/) ;)

>SageMaker takes away most of your complex tasks and lets you focus on experimentation and training your models by its wide range toolkit,You can learn Amazon SageMaker even if you don't know much about ML, i also had trained only few regression and clustering models before starting SageMaker. (it's fun)

You can read more about [SageMaker]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-mlconcepts.html) 
updates at their website: [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/artificial-intelligence/sagemaker/)

## AWS & GPUs:
**From  having a relatively small neural network to waiting for many days of training** \
-There are various EC2 instances available with different GPU configurations that you can pick from, depending upon your budget and need of training model. 
>Now if you don't know why we use GPU. \
CPU are used for handling single complex tasks sequentially while GPU are great at handeling parellel tasks. Vectorization is core operation in ML (eg: bias and weight)
>
To utilize the computational power of GPUs we need strong software, \
Companies like NVIDIA are also working towards ML | AI as toolkits like TensorFlow need well designed acceleration libraries like 
[Cuda X](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-libraries#:~:text=NVIDIA%20CUDA%2DXâ„¢%2C%20built,AI%20and%20high%2Dperformance%20computing.), everyone knows Ai Ml is a growing market with bright future, NVIDIA also has invested in [containers](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/containers) that can help avoid dependencies hell.

(this is time consuming)
