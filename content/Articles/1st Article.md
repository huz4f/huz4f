# Cloud Computing and AI | ML 
## -SageMaker and Modern day ML
### Evolvement and need of ML
We know, Machiene Learning has evolved tremendously over the past decade and now has applications in nearly every field. There is a need for mastery of a wider toolset to move ML experiments from resource phase to more practical applications. \
But the work of building ML projects is really complex and tedious with a lot of manual workflows.We know we are still at the beginning of AI and ML although incredible amount of progress is being made and it holds the future of various industries from business, education, tech to healthcare. \
So far most of the development and testing of models have been done locally but the downside is you need multiple virtual environments for different models and frameworks, Also these is limit to the amount of data you can load into the memory. \
The next common way to develop and run ML models is on a set of powerful servers which may seem less expensive up front, but either they are underutilized or need time and money.
>SageMaker takes away most of your complex tasks and lets you focus on experimentation and training your models by its wide range toolkit,You can learn Amazon SageMaker even if you don't know much about ML, i also had trained only few regression and clustering models before starting SageMaker. (it's fun)

You can Read more about [SageMaker]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-mlconcepts.html)

### AWS & GPUs 
There are various EC2 instances available with different GPU configurations that you can pick from depending upon your budget and need of training model. 
>Now if you don't know why we use GPU? \
CPU are used for handling single complex tasks sequentially while GPU are great at handeling parellel tasks.
>
Is your neural network relatively small? or can you wait for many days of training?
