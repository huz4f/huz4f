# Cloud Computing & ML | AI
## -SageMaker and Modern day Machine Learning
### Evolvement and need of ML
We know, Machine Learning has evolved tremendously over the past decade and now has applications in nearly every field. There is a need for mastery of a wider toolset to move ML experiments from resource phase to more practical applications. \
But the work of building ML projects is really complex and tedious with a lot of manual workflows.We know we are still at the beginning of AI and ML although incredible amount of progress is being made and it holds the future of various industries from business, education, tech to healthcare. \
So far most of the development and testing of models have been done locally but the downside is you need multiple virtual environments for different models and frameworks, Also there is a limit to the amount of data you can load into the memory. \
The next common way to develop and run ML models is on a set of powerful servers which may seem less expensive up front, but either they are underutilized or need time and money.
### SageMaker & DevOps
From not having to download large amount of data to having updated ml frameworks and algorithms at your finger tips,
SageMaker studio makes Machine Learning much convenient, scalable and fast. You can directly put training data from S3 to your customized EC2 instance,
Want to add new features? \
You dont have to go through the whole process of data prep, model training and deployment. You can use jenkins or [CodePipeLine](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/features/) ;)

>SageMaker takes away most of your complex tasks and lets you focus on experimentation and training your models by its wide range toolkit,Y ou can learn Amazon SageMaker even if you don't know much about ML, i also had trained only few regression and clustering models before starting SageMaker. (it's fun)
>
You can read more about [SageMaker]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-mlconcepts.html) 
updates at their website: [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/artificial-intelligence/sagemaker/)

#### AWS & GPUs
**Is your neural network relatively small? or can you wait for many days of training?** \
-There are various EC2 instances available with different GPU configurations that you can pick from, depending upon your budget and need of training model. 
>Now if you don't know why we use GPU. \
CPU are used for handling single complex tasks sequentially while GPU are great at handeling parellel tasks. Vectorization is core operation in ML (eg: bias and weight)
>
To utilize the computational power of GPUs we need strong software, \
Companies like NVIDIA are also working towards ML | AI as toolkits like TensorFlow need well designed acceleration libraries like 
[Cuda X](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-libraries#:~:text=NVIDIA%20CUDA%2DXâ„¢%2C%20built,AI%20and%20high%2Dperformance%20computing.), everyone knows Ai Ml is a growing market with bright future, NVIDIA also has invested in [containers](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/containers) that can help avoid dependencies hell.

(will write more, this is time consuming)

>Spent first 10 days of jan completing a ML course that i had enrolled for 6 months ago
>(spent most of that time learning maths) after that i started studying for CompTIA A+
>>Got sick and having to stay in bed all day learnt to use AWS and made this website 
>

i don't remember right now if i learnt anything else.

# Networks & CyberSecurity 
i wont write about this,it will be waste of time and i don't need to revise, \
for Cyber Sec you need to start from basic understanding of data and what networks are, i will provide link if you want to check your interest:
- [Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tutorials/)
- [Basic CyberSec](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/cyber-security-for-beginners)
