Few days ago right when i woke up i just decided to make a website,learnt some html css and made a crappy (somehow working) static web page(blog cause it's easy) and then i Got bored-forgot about it \
tonight when i was trying to sleep from flu,i felt like doing it no matter how dull it feels(been procrastinating from couple years now),\
-it's working on local host pretty fine \
will deploy it after i sleep hopefully.
