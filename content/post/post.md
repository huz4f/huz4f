Probably last week, \
I remember just waking up and then deciding to make a website,learnt some html css and made a crappy (somehow working) static web page. \
A blog to be precise because what else can you think of, then i got bored and forgot about it :P \
tonight when i was trying to sleep from flu,i felt like doing it no matter how dull it feels (been procrastinating this from couple years now),\
-it's working on local host pretty fine \
will deploy it after i sleep hopefully.
