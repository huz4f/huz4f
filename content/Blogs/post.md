# Writing this on: January 29, 2024  03:48
Probably last week, \
I remember just waking up and then deciding to make a website, \
learnt some html, css and made a crappy (somehow working) static web page. \
A blog to be precise because what else can you think of, \
then i got bored and forgot about it :P \
tonight when i was trying to sleep from flu,i felt like doing it no matter how dull it feels (been procrastinating this from couple years now),
> it's working on local host pretty fine \
will deploy it after i sleep hopefully.
>
i remember in 6th grade i made a html css website i wish i could get that file somehow :/ \
anyways **Previous static website:**

-i've also decided to keep it alive \
as last year one of my friends suggested me to write stuff saying,
our mind tricks us into thinking we've learnt alot but when we sit to write about the knowledge we've gained, 
we realize it's an illusion, goes without saying writing gives clarity and i've always hated writing on pages :P so maybe i'll write about what i've to revision or idk. \
(i've a pretty bad handwriting) \
anyways this is how it used to look:
