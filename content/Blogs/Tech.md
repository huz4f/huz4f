We all know technological advancements have been drastically changing human lives, from extending our lifespan to ease of many tasks we now take forgranted.

So what are these Ramifications of Technology and how has it affected our lives beyond its marvellous breakthroughs?

# Psychological

![](/articles/rat.png)
Let's start with the obvious one, 

### "Lack of Focus"  
With instant access to information and rapid communication. \
Perception of time and patience has been altered, \
We all have a superfast computer in our pockets with 4G this has fostered an expectation of immediate results. Patience for slower processes has eroded in our lives. \
Here is a pretty good documentary i watched few years ago [The Social Dilemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0), 

Emphasizing how attention span has decreased, \
You might have heard an average human has lower attention span than a goldfish now, not going to research if it's true but here is a truth: 
>6 hours and 58 minutes per day is screen time of an average human today. 
>
Let that sink it, If you ever reduce it to less than 1hr you will realize alot of things change.

Researchers from France and the United Kingdom found that frequent media multitasking may contribute to diminished gray matter in the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain where attentional control resides (Loh & Kanai, 2014).

### Digital Amnesia
The more we outsource tasks to smartphones, the less we use our memories. \
Which become weaker and forcing us to depend more on the devices. 

Have you needed a calculator to solve basic calculations.
Ok let me rephrase it, \
I've only 2-3 phone numbers memorized and it is not easy for me to remember a phone number, on the other hand i know few people who don't save contacts on their phone and have even my phone number memorized (even i used to get confused sometimes what my phone number is). \
If  you are thinking we have our mobile phone we don't need to care about such trivial things or by outsourcing tasks which require mental efforts, we are letting our minds focus on more productive tasks. \
Let me suggest you to read this : [Harvard paper](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dwegner/files/sparrow_et_al._2011.pdf)

"If you don't use something, You lose it" it was written in some book \
(i am bad at remembering names)

The dependency on GPS navigation systems reduces the brain density matter in the hippocampus, causing diseases like depression and dementia. [check](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156656/)

Short term memory is destroyed by short videos, \
this is a personal experience and i am glad i hardly use any social media. 

Here is a convincing example, \
 When you watch short videos on instagram or YouTube . There has been surveyes which shows that if you watch a full movie or read a book, you will be able to narrate the story even after few days. But if you watch 100s of short videos (10–20 sec videos), you are not be able to recollect even 5 of them right after you put down your mobile. These short videos are like junk food for brain, it does not allow or give enough time for your brain to settle down and process. Brain keep switching between different videos which are of different theme, different genre, different types.


### Feeling content
Let's talk about living in the moment and pleasure. \
When you go out, sit in the rain or watch sunset ask yourself how much time do you actually spend feeling that feeling. Remember when we were kids and all we focused on was the current experience. Aren't those one of the best memories we all have. \
When we are distracted, we fail to pay attention and do not form good memories. Short-term memories fail to get transferred into long-term memories and we don’t form insights.

Brain can become hyperstimulated by dopamine. This overstimulation can make our brain's pleasure centers less responsive to other enjoyable experiences, such as eating a meal, reading a book, having a conversation, or holding hands.




### Change of character
The internet can create a sense of individuality, making us feel unique. However, it's important to reflect on whether this feeling is genuine.

Many technological advancements including advertising and social media often fuel personality disorders. \
There are many studies showing depression and feeling envious has increased with spending more time on the interent. Not only limtited to making a person feel weak or having low self esteem. A person can also live in fantasy world online and have high confidence while achieving nothing in real life, not only limited to causing further hate towards real life but causing many problems and being stuck in a loop. 

Being able to find communities online is very beneficial yet there is also another side to this coin.
[Impulsivity, narcissism, and aggression](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315349367_The_Internet%27s_effect_on_personality_traits_An_important_casualty_of_the_Internet_addiction_paradigm#:~:text=Results%20Impulsivity%2C%20narcissism%2C%20and%20aggression,with%20possible%20negative%20offline%20consequences.) has increased. 

Being different is good but having support for you weaknesses and stupidity then portraying it as normal is not. Spending time without your phone and detoxifying once in a while from the internet to reflect should be encouraged.

### There are many other issues like 

- Easy access to search engines can sometimes encourage a reliance on readily available solutions rather than cultivating deeper critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

- [Technology is Killing Creativity](https://rindle.com/blog/is-technology-killing-creativity)


Being obsessed with psychology since my early teens i can talk about this topic for hours, i'll just end it here with words (of someone i don't remember who) \
' We should regularly ask ourselves am i using this, or is it using me? '

# Physical

Let's start with Sleep disturbance? 
- Light from electronic devices at night can hinder circadian rhythm. [more](https://sleepdoctor.com/technology/#:~:text=transition%20to%20sleep.-,Technology%20Can%20Have%20Adverse%20Effects%20on%20Sleep,affect%20attentiveness%20the%20following%20day.)

Prolonged sitting in front of screens contributes to a sedentary lifestyle, which increases the risk of:
- Obesity
- Heart disease
- Type 2 diabetes
- Muscle and joint problems
- Poor posture and weakness as humans were designed for physical activity 

Human body is made to endure certain conditions that have been taken care of by technology, as a result we have become weak.

While technology enhances connectivity, it can also hinder the development of in-depth, face-to-face social skills necessary for strong interpersonal relationships.
