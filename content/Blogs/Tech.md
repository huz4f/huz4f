Choosing a name for this was quite hard, \
We all know technological advancements have been drastically changing human lives, from extending lifespan to ease of many tasks we now take forgranted, 

So what are these Ramifications of Technology and how has it affected our lives beyond its marvellous breakthroughs? 
I will divide this into 3 parts.
- [Psychological effects](#psychological)
- [Physical changes](#physical)
- [Social Adaptation](#social)

# Psychological

Let's start with the obvious one, 

### "Lack of Focus"  
With instant access to information and rapid communication. \
Perception of time and patience has been altered, \
We all have a superfast computer in our pockets with 5G this has fostered an expectation of immediate results. Patience for slower processes has eroded in our lives. \
Here is a pretty good documentary i watched few years ago [The Social Dilemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0), 

Emphasizing how attention span has decreased, \
You might have heard an average human has lower attention span than a goldfish now, not going to research if it's but here is a truth: \
6 hours and 58 minutes per day is screen time of an average human today. \
Let that sink it, If you ever reduce it to less than 1hr you will realize alot of things change.

### Exposure of kids to youtube / social media at very young age
Early childhood experiences from birth to age 8 affect the development of the brain's architecture, which provides the foundation for all future learning, behavior and health.

Even after 8 years,
Being an only child when i was a kid i only had my grandma at home most of the times so i loved my computer, it was like a whole universe in my hands all inside my room.

Back then you needed a big system just to run windows and a 1GB file took whole day to download

### Change of personality even though it gives you false feeling of individuality



Changes in Problem-Solving: Easy access to search engines can sometimes encourage a reliance on readily available solutions rather than cultivating deeper critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

### Digital Amnesia


Being obsessed with psychology since my early teens i can talk about this topic for hours, i'll just end it here with words of someone (i don't remember who) \
' We should regularly ask ourselves am i using this, or is it using me? '

# Social
Evolving Relationships and Social Skills: While technology enhances connectivity, it can also hinder the development of in-depth, face-to-face social skills necessary for strong interpersonal relationships.
