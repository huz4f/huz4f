Ending august, reading man's search for meaning again.

Heavy rain, No network and a broken leg. Amidst all this i realize this year also is coming to an end and staying still is something my mind never considers an option lately, but here i am after abusing my leg's injury i reconsider this mindset that men used to go to war with broken legs. I never liked to be dependent on anyone i don't want this injurt to hit me in my old age.
