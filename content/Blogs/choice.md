#### Choices Create illusion, Not Liberation.

#### "we dont want freedom we want the struggle for freedom" -ibsen
What would we want if our memetic desires did not contribute to the identity that we have given ourselves. Who are we in this world, if our childhood did not imprint our attachment style in us, \
And what are we chasing if it all becomes absurd in the end ?

Without childhood wounds driving us…
→ Would ambition be softer or sharper? 


The actual question is wwould it even exist. We work on our psychological, social and physiological goal but maybe the only actual goal of lies in the spritual side, we are chasing it because everyone else is also chasing just an illusion. \
Human's prefrontal cortex takes 25 years (more than any other being) to mature, the death gives meaning to life and the one's who came before us we take direction from them but where are we going, do we want to end up where they did but  here is the thing, \
choices are never about “right or wrong”
it’s about choosing to live with full consciousness, despite the absurd.

Study of Universe 25 shows us how there only exists illusion of an utopia. \


Sense of purpose is the main driving force for a man. \
There is this story about a man in "man's serach for meaning" where he has a prophetic dream that war would end on a specific date. He belived it with his whole heart, endured everything until then. As the time passed and reality was not in his favor, not only his mind but his immune system also started to give up and he actually died in 48 hours after that date.


No injury. No infection. \
Just the death of hope → death of the body.


### When the mind loses it's why, the body gives up how




it takes 25 years to mature prefrontal cortex in humans more than any other being

it allows genetic expression as the environment needs

learning what counts as the right thing


Isn't too much genius madness maybe because

> #### It fades. The shine dulls. And you're left wondering: *Was that it?*

Looking into my personal life, \
I cannot say I’ve been a nihilist. \
I didn’t suffer from clinical anhedonia. \
But i’ve always hovered somewhere in between **not quite empty, never quite full.**

#### Every goal you achieve, 
Every milestone you hit, every desire that once burned within you — when finally attained, somehow loses its power.  

#### It’s the summer of ‘25. 
I just completed my final exams, cleared all my backlogs \
— goals I set a year ago, \
most of which I’ve now accomplished. \
But looking back… \
**I wonder did I really believe these things would make me feel something?** \
Would they make me love myself or increase my self respect? 


Today, as I walked out of that exam room with every logical reason to feel relief or triumph, there wasn’t even a sigh. Just… **emptiness**

#### i wonder: were the milestones too small?  
Or am I forever chasing something bigger — always stretching toward a horizon that keeps moving? Maybe it's just \
**Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky’s Prospect Theory** in motion~
> *“People fear loss \
more than they value gain.”*  

Maybe the moment something is achieved, the gain is already devalued in our MIND. We discount it.  We move on. \
We search for the next high.


Even during my early teens, I had glimpses of this strange awareness that ***chasing something with the hope it will change how you feel inside is the most elaborate illusion of all***.
And it’s strange — i’ve gotten almost everything i’ve ever wanted. And yet, i’ve never been able to fully hold it. Just teaching me the absurdity of it all.

Maybe it's just
 ***“The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”***  \

## The Paradox of Progress

Every time humanity advances — every time we create technology, more freedom, new access — we multiply our choices.  
***But with more choices comes more anxiety. More comparison. More regret.***

We think we want freedom. But we forget:  
> With every option we say “yes” to, we silently bury the rest

#### Real freedom doesn’t lie in having endless options. It lies in *knowing what you want,* choosing it *with awareness,* and *not needing anything else.*

### Because contentment is not in having everything

> **it is in choosing one thing — and letting go of everything else.**



###  Existentialism is a Humanism  — *Jean-Paul Sartre* 

*“Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.”* \
We are free  and that terrifying freedom means every choice we make defines us. 

That is both the burden and the beauty.  
**We are condemned to be free.**

---

There is no better feeling than chasing a goal you know is *authentically your own.*  
Not to prove something. Not to please someone. But because ***maybe it moves something inside you.*
*The destination will never fulfill you.***

> **The journey is the only place you ever really live. Trust your ***'maktub'***.**
