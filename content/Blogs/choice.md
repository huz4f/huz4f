#### Choices Create illusion, Not Liberation.

 *“We search for purpose. The universe offers silence.”* **-The Myth of Sisyphus**

---
#### Every goal you achieve, 
Every milestone you hit, every desire that once burned within you — when finally attained, somehow loses its power.  

## Choice is not about “right or wrong” 
**— it’s about choosing to live with full consciousness, despite the absurd.**

> #### It fades. The shine dulls. And you're left wondering: *Was that it?*

Looking into my personal life, \
I cannot say I’ve been a nihilist. \
I didn’t suffer from clinical anhedonia. \
But i’ve always hovered somewhere in between **not quite empty, never quite full.**

#### It’s the summer of ‘25. 
I just completed my final exams, cleared all my backlogs — goals I set a year ago, \
most of which I’ve now accomplished. \
But looking back… \
**I wonder did I really believe these things would make me feel something?** \
Would they make me love myself or increase my self respect? 


Today, as I walked out of that exam room with every logical reason to feel relief or triumph, there wasn’t even a sigh. Just… **emptiness**

#### i wonder: were the milestones too small?  
Or am I forever chasing something bigger — always stretching toward a horizon that keeps moving? Maybe it's just \
**Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky’s Prospect Theory** in motion~
> *“People fear loss \
more than they value gain.”*  

Maybe the moment something is achieved, the gain is already devalued in our MIND. We discount it.  We move on. \
We search for the next high.


Even during my early teens, I had glimpses of this strange awareness that ***chasing something with the hope it will change how you feel inside is the most elaborate illusion of all***.
And it’s strange — i’ve gotten almost everything i’ve ever wanted. And yet, i’ve never been able to fully hold it. Just teaching me the absurdity of it all.

Maybe it's just
 ***“The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”***  \
 — Albert Camus

## The Paradox of Progress

Every time humanity advances — every time we create technology, more freedom, new access — we multiply our choices.  
***But with more choices comes more anxiety. More comparison. More regret.***

We think we want freedom. But we forget:  
> With every option we say “yes” to, we silently bury the rest

#### Real freedom doesn’t lie in having endless options. It lies in *knowing what you want,* choosing it *with awareness,* and *not needing anything else.*

### Because contentment is not in having everything

> **it is in choosing one thing — and letting go of everything else.**



###  Existentialism is a Humanism  — *Jean-Paul Sartre* 

*“Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.”* \
We are free  and that terrifying freedom means every choice we make defines us. 

That is both the burden and the beauty.  
**We are condemned to be free.**

---

There is no better feeling than chasing a goal you know is *authentically your own.*  
Not to prove something. Not to please someone. But because ***maybe it moves something inside you.*
*The destination will never fulfill you.***

> **The journey is the only place you ever really live. Trust your ***'maktub'***.**
