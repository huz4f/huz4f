I write this blog about tech so here i go, Tech is fast (faster than you think). When you know about an advancement in today's age it is already out dated. So the ALGORITHM isn't analyzing anything. There isn't much to analyze, people today are predicatable, same, easy distracted, low attention span, can't handle silence let alone boredom(how did we end up here, that's something quietude demanding) .So Mr.ALGORITHM in today's age isn't learning it is actually Programming. A bold statement? Then again i ask why do i romanticize something i don't want to. Why everyone likes the same music ? Why people follow trends so easily and they get outdated so fast...idk it's something boring (they say for my adhd brain).


Excess perception with low internal discipline is what we call madness. \



Tech is fast
