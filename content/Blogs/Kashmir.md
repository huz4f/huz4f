### Google 'Kashmir's Fertility Rate" and you get:

#### These are some genuine reasons but what can be the underlying cause?
This might be the most important thing kashmir should focus on yet it is getting negleted and unnoticed by everyone.

>Urban areas now having TFR of 1.2 and rural 1.5, 35% women and 45 % men have fertility problems. **Steepest decline of TFR in our nation.** Why and how ?

As a local i can tell you my fair share of insights but here are some stories that might give you a deeper understanding of what might be the problem.
#### This topic won't be in news channels or highlighted on social media because when kashmir mentioned, kashmiris are the least intresting topic to discuss.

## Mimetic Desires & Financial Pressure
Being interested in psychology since 14, i always questioned things and cultural shifts. \
If you ask yourself what things you want right now, you will realize most of them are general wants, almost everyone wants them. Like the latest iPhone or a specific car, You want to be good at something (that maybe you don't even actually like) , is it validation? 
#### But why?
> Sense of belonging? Clinical psychology says, most of our desires aren't even our own. Deep down every human being needs connection, sense of belonging to a community. Most of our desires are rooted in this since early childhood.

### White collar
So, last month around 4am i hopped on a call with an old friend. This guy currently lives in Melbourne, so naturally he must have beeen awake and we talked for hours about how he is doing and stuff going on in his personal life. How he recently completed his masters and now he is looking for a job there, since companies have to pay more for immigrant employee so they prefer hiring local ones and there is no advancement in kashmir's job market. His dad came to visit him for the first time so he was busy showing him around. This guy's parents are doctors here and he said drug abuse is on rise and health is declining in kashmir, \
how various different kind of casualties have become more common now...

So where am i going with this? This is not about how there is no time for bonding or forming genuine connections or life moves fast today. My friends who have moved out or travel alot, almost all of them agree on kashmiri obsession of owning a house and having a big wedding, like there is nothing else to life to live for. Like the friend i mentioned above, he also told me that his father has bought and sold properties and they've relocated couple of times, "what for?" he said, Now he lives in an empty house.

What shifted society's focus from building a healthy home to constructing a bigger house

My neighbor, also a doctor who fought cancer twice, lives alone and is around 80. He reads newspaper in the garden after mowing the lawn (cool right). A few years ago I also wanted to be like him, living in my own world but at the end what do you take with you? How did you impact lives around you? The family you built ? Or What you did for the people, who will remember you?


Someone once told me "It's about what you leave in people not what we leave for them". People who continue the good in you and people who are there to take care of you is something you need to earn and actually need at the end.

>This story is followed by almost everyone,\
Many of my own relatives moved away with their families, Leaving their parents behind  with houses they spent their whole lives building.
Its hard to rewire yourself and understand what you actually want, harder to change a larger system.

 **Pressure of having these "culture made prerequisite for marriage" not only delays it but affects mental and physical health adversely.**
### Blue collar
Met this guy near Jehlum and his cat got our conversation started. It was his lunch break (This guy works at a local restaurant) \
As he told me more about himself,i came to know that he is of my age and has been working for more than 8 years (he started at 14), he provides for his family and couldn't get education but
