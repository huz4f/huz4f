### When you Google 'Kashmir's Fertility Rate" you get this:

#### Google gives reasons that actually make sense but what can be the underlying cause?
People are not even aware, this might be the most important thing to focus on yet is getting negleted and unnoticed by almost everyone, even to me it randomly crossed my mind and i googled about it.

>Urban areas now having TFR of 1.2 and rural 1.5, 35% women and 45 % men have fertility problems. **Steepest decline of TFR in our nation.** Why and how ?

As a local i can tell you my fair share of insights but i have some stories that might give you a deeper understanding.
#### This topic won't be in news channels or highlighted on social media because when we hear kashmir, kashmiris are the least intresting topic that comes to our mind.

## Mimetic Desires & Financial Pressure
Being interested in psychology since 14 i always questioned things and cultural shifts. \
If you ask yourself what things you want right now, you will realize most of them are general wants, almost everyone wants them. Like the latest iPhone or a specific car, You want to be good at something that maybe you don't actually even like, is it validation? 
#### But why?
> Sense of belonging? Clinical psychology says, most of our desires aren't even our own. Deep down every human being needs connection and belong to a community.

So, last month around 4am i was going through my contacts list and an old friend's name popped up. This guy currently lives in Melbourne, i thought he must be awake so i called him and we talked for hours about how he is doing and stuff. How he recently completed his masters and now he is looking for a job there, as they have to pay more for immigrant employee so they prefer local ones and there is no advancement in kashmir's job market, \
His dad came to visit him for the first time so he was busy showing him around. This guy's parents are doctors here and he said drug abuse is on rise and health is declining in kashmir, what kind of casualties are more common now that did not exist few years ago...

So where am i getting with this? My friends who moved out or travel alot, almost all of them say that kashmiris only live for builidng a house and having a big wedding. Like the guy i mentioned above, he also told me that his father has bought and sold properties and they relocated couple of times, "what for?" he said, Now he lives in an empty house.

My neighbor, also a doctor who faught cancer twice, lives alone, is maybe around 80 and reads newspaper in the garden after doing lawning (cool right). Few years ago i also wanted to be like him, living in my own world but at the end what do you take with yourself.


 A friend once told me "it's about what you leave in people not what we leave for them". Adding value to people's lives sounded like the best way to live your life but having people who remember you long after you are gone and people who are there to take care of you is something you cannot buy and actually live for.

Or many of my own relatives who live somewhere else with their families and their parents are alone here they spent their whole life making. **Pressure of having these culture made prerequisite for marriage not only delays it but affects your mental and physical health**
