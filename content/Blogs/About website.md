# Writing this on: January 29, 2024  03:48
Probably last week, \
I remember just waking up and then deciding to make a website, \
learnt some html, css and made a crappy (somehow working) static web page. \
A blog to be precise because what else can you think of, \
then i got bored and forgot about it :P \
tonight when i was trying to sleep from flu,i felt like doing it no matter how dull it feels (been procrastinating this from couple years now),
> it's working on local host pretty fine \
will deploy it after i sleep hopefully.
>
i remember in 6th grade i made a html css website i wish i could get that file somehow :/ \
anyways **Previous static website:**

# Updated website on: Feb 1st, 2024
> Redesigned the whole website and gave it a frame

-i've also decided to keep it alive \
as last year one of my friends suggested me to write stuff saying,
our mind tricks us into thinking we've learnt alot but when we sit to write about the knowledge we've gained, 
we realize it's an illusion, goes without saying writing gives clarity and i've always hated writing on pages :P so maybe i'll write about what i've to revision or idk. \
(i've a pretty bad handwriting) \
anyways this is how it used to look:

Removed wiki section as i will have to write more content that way lol , \
An empty menu is what i don't want, keeping it minimal \
I will put everything other than articles in blog.


Writing not only makes you reflect, realize and think about new possibilites , \
In your professional life you need to write reports even last month i was doing some courses and part of the exam was writing your reports and perspectives on given topic.


A lot of people are writing on their personal blogs. The trend spiked up again since changes in twitter (i personally know a friend who was active, even had verified account and deleted it after 'X' started). People are realising that no centralized social media is gonna be reliable so they are starting their own personal spaces on the web which they own and where they can put anything they want. I just bumped into an article explaining why some prolific writer on medium switched to his personal blog.
