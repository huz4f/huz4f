**Came across this while reading a book:** 
>Story is about  a little sheep in a Shepherd's flock.
>
This little sheep liked to wander off and Shepherd after noticing it couple of times broke off all it's legs (brutal right). Aren't shephered supposed to love sheep? 

Now he carries this 4 legged broken sheep everywhere around his neck, feeding, washing and taking care of everything till finally the sheep is ready to go. \
Through this sheep learns how lucky he is for having Mr.Shepherd. 

Now this story can be interpreted in many ways as reality and everything init is equivocal \
But was the curiosity of little sheep worth losing the shephered that saw beyond the hills it wanted to explore? 
- Is every sheep lucky enough to experience this?
- Do we appreciate things or hold onto our values let alone value of others.
- Are we able to accept that even if you are smartest human alive, \
God sees far beyond what he is showing you right now.

>Are we able to trust with our eyes closed?
