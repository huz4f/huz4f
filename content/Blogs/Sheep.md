**Came across this while reading a book:** 
>Story is about  a little sheep in a Shepherd's flock, 
>
This little sheep liked to wander off and Mr.Shepherd after noticing it couple times broke off all his legs (brutal right). Aren't shephered supposed to love sheep? 

Now he has to carry this 4 legged broken sheep everywhere around his neck, feeding, washing and taking care of everything till finally the sheep is ready to go. \
Through this sheep realized how lucky he is for having Shepherd. 

Now this story can be interpreted in many ways as reality and everything init is equivocal \
But was the curiosity of little sheep worth losing the shephered that saw beyond the hill it wanted to explore? 
- Is everyone lucky enough to experience this?
- Do we realize things or hold onto our values let alone value of others.
- Can we accept that even if you are smartest human alive, \
God sees far beyond what he is showing you right now.


how short life is and humans can attain only certain amount of wisdom ?

are we able to trust with our eyes closed?
